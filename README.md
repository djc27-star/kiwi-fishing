A classification problem based on a water potability dataset

In a statistical report, you need to be brief, clear, and concise. 
I am treating the reader as a policymaker with basic knowledge of statistics, 
who is very busy and wants to spend a minute reading the report and already understand the main points.
This is line with previous projects I have done in univeristy.
As such the report is limited to one page with no figures.
